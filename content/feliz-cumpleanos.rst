Y dice así:

    | For 27 years I've been trying
    | to believe and confide in
    | different people I found
    | Some of them got closer than others
    | and some wouldn't even bother
    | and then you came around
    | I didn't really know what to call you
    | You didn't know me at all
    | but I was happy to explain
    | I never really knew how to move you
    | so I tried to intrude through
    | the little holes in your veins
    |
    | And I saw you
    | But that's not an invitation
    | that's all I get
    | If this is communication
    | I disconnect
    | I've seen you, I know you
    | but I don't know how to connect
    | so I disconnect
    |
    | You always seem to know where to find me
    | and I'm, still here behind you
    | in the corner of your eye
    | I never really learnt how to love you
    | but I know that I love you
    | through the hole in the sky
    | where I see you
    | and that's not an invitation that's all I get
    | If this is communication
    | I disconnect
    | I've seen you, I know you
    | but I don't know how to connect
    | so I disconnect
    |
    | Well this is an invitation
    | it's not a threat
    | If you want communication
    | that's what you get
    | I'm talking and talking
    | but I don't know how to connect
    | and I hold a record for being patient
    | with your kind of hesitation
    | I need you, you want me
    | but I don't know how to connect
    | so I disconnect
    | I disconnect

Bueno, pues ya llegó el día que cada vez ilusiona menos, y es que ya van
27 primaveras. Y yo espero que este año sea el año en el que todo dé un
giro de 360º; el año ideal para abandonar un presente que ya no me
corresponde vivir.

Esperemos que así sea.

Ah! y felicidades (a mi mismo, por supuesto)
